                <p>I am a 19-year-old student currently enrolled in the Computer Engineering program at York University, where I am in my second year. As a member of the Dean's Honor Roll, I am deeply passionate about programming and hardware systems, and I am dedicated to exploring and expanding my knowledge in these fields.
                     Outside of academics, I stay active through sports and working out, and I am involved in several university clubs, including the Muslim Student Association (MSA), the Engineering Society, the Robotics Society, and the STEM Fellowship Club. I was honored to receive <strong>The Gordon and Agnes (Twambley) Brash Award in Engineering</strong> for my academic excellence and contributions to extracurricular activities.
                      I am committed to continuing my personal and professional development, both within my studies and in my engagement with the university community.</p>
